<h1>Necessary Competition and Stress</h1>

<p>Competition is desired - until it breaks you. Capitalism is just that: compete until the adequate ones are left standing, similar to Darwin’s notion of “survival of the fittest.” When a niche becomes saturated, the most efficient and effective will be left standing. I am not making a case against capitalism, as I actually think that it is necessary, but I wanted to voice some observations as a somewhat clueless college student.</p>

<p><b>Why are college students so stressed?</b></p>

<p>I think a large part of it is due to the advent of the different social medias and the instant gratification technology provides us. Platforms such as Facebook and Linkedin make it so easy to flaunt those Goldman Sachs or Google internships without realizing the work (nepotism?) it took to get to those positions. It is only natural to compare yourself with classmates. When we are behind, we feel inadequate.</p>

<p id=KochQuote>“Comparison is the root of all unhappiness.”</p>
 
<p>I want to remind everyone to step back and remember that life is not a journey - securing a good job and getting good grades are not an endgame. Make sure you enjoy yourself and the process.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBpaUICxEhk"> Life is not a Journey</a></p>

<p>Everyone wants security, whether it be financial, health, or familial. It is human nature to want to be safe and comfortable. This is what education is for many people: a vehicle for security and upward mobility. This is a fair reason for attending university and wanting to be on the top, but is a shift from the former maxim of “searching for knowledge and truth.”</p>

<p><i>Side note: I feel that pre-professionalism and the obsession with grades somewhat sullies the idea of intellectual curiosity, as some students are incentivized to preserve their grades by any means possible. This is particularly evident in some of the programs where grades matter, such as pre-med and banking. I often see people talking about the “easy As” rather than challenging themselves and learning about something new, which is justifiable by their career goals. I don’t know if this culture can be reshaped, as quality positions seem to desire perfection.</i></p>

<p>In order to differentiate the vast number of applicants, graduate school admissions and employers want some empirical scale. One common point of contention among stressed students is grade point average, which is generally an indicator of conscientiousness and mastery of knowledge. We are often told that in order to get into a good program or job we must maintain the best grades, because if we don’t, we simply aren't good enough. I disagree with that notion. Temporary defeat is not permanent failure. If you really want it, disregard the setbacks and go get it.</p>

<p>Perfection is ideal but often unattainable without other sacrifices (social life, physical and mental health, sleep.) This culture of competition and wanting to be the best is great in the sense of achievement, but at what cost? Relative to you, is it worth it? If yes, keep trudging on. If not, re-evaluate.</p>

		<p><b>So how do we prove knowledge and conscientiousness without tests and grades?</b></p>

<p>It’s hard to. I don’t think there is a way to efficiently and objectively test someone’s knowledge without giving a standardized test, which for the most part, is how the current system is setup. Graduate schools already utilize different tests such as the GRE, and some employers utilize technical tests. </p>

<p>I would suggest maintaining an online portfolio of work completed and also update it with write ups, new insights, and class materials. This helps reinforce the material learned while also showing others that you have a good understanding of it. Ultimately, just do what you enjoy and remember it isn’t the end of the world if you aren’t perfect. Life is too short to be spending time on something that isn’t worthwhile.</p>
