<h1> Generalizations -> Stereotypes -> Prejudice -> Friends? </h1>

<p>“Don’t generalize.” We hear this all too often, yet we all do it in some shape or form. It is human nature. Maybe generalizing and trusting our past experiences is a learning mechanism developed somewhere along our evolutionary timeline? </p>

<p>As humans, we love predictability, and I think that we use generalizations as sort of a quick and dirty way to make judgments. An event occurs -> we make associations between that event, and the more often those events  occur, the stronger the associations become.</p>

<p>An example in nature is the avoidance of poisonous plants. Some herbivores test out small samples of different plants, make associations between taste, smell, looks, ect, and eventually learn what to avoid and what is safe to eat. However this system isn't perfect (as it is pretty hard to accurately identify 100% of edible plants), so they must generalize and try to pick those that they have experience with. However, this generalization allows for Batesian mimicry, where a harmless plant mimics the appearance of a poisonous one, and the herbivore consequently misses out on a potential food source because it generalized. So generalization is not perfect, but it is an effective way to pass judgment.</p>

<p>The reason why generalizing is so condemned is because they are either:</p>

<p>1: Untrue and oversimplified (Stereotypes)</p>

<p id=KochQuote> Stereotypes lose their power when the world is found to be more complex than the stereotype would suggest. When we learn that individuals do not fit the group stereotype, then it begins to fall apart. - Ed Koch</p>

<p>2: True/have basis, but discriminate against the exceptions of a group.</p>
	
<p>In a perfect world, everyone is looked at as an individual. However, the problem with this is that in order to get an accurate reading of the individual, it requires time and many interactions. It is much easier to build a profile of someone based off of generalizations and a small sample size of interactions. </p>

<p>You can have a negative first impression primed with smack-talk from peers and learn over time that the individual is really not as bad as you thought they were. I have made some good friends through spending time with them and learning about their values. Conversely, you can also have a couple positive interactions and learn over time that the person you thought was great was actually not that good of a person/friend.</p>

<p>So what is the next step? If we want accuracy, we must sacrifice more time to learn. If we want to save time and generalize, we sacrifice accuracy. The world of generalizations is multidimensional and obviously way more complex than what I am making it out to be, but I think that as people, we should take more time to learn about the content of someone’s character instead of making snap-judgments, and to do this, you must learn what the individual’s values are.</p>
