	<h1>So who is this kid?</h1>
	
	<div id=p1><p>	Mix in a speck of placid obsessiveness, the aspiration for fulfillment, a heap of curiosity, and you get the slight discombobulation of me --- a guy named Jason.</p></div>  

	<div><p>	I grew up in the small town of <span class="mapThis" place="Milpitas, California" zoom="7">Milpitas, California</span> (directly next to San Jose) and was raised by two janitors who fled their respective countries (Khmer Rogue occupation of Cambodia, China) to live a better life. Being able to grow in the auspicious environment of the Silicon Valley was truly a blessing, but would not have been possible had my parents not settled before the technology boom (which I am infinitely times grateful for!) </p>
	
	<div><p>	My first love was economics. I look at it like a chess game - you move a piece and the relationships on the board change. In my freshman summer of high school, I played a video game called Madden Mobile with my football teammates. I remember browsing the Internet and reading about the power <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil">Standard Oil</a> had over the world and realized that the concept of monopolies could be applied in any market, even Madden Mobile. I had lots of capital in the game and recognized that certain collectibles were scarce, and when one controls the supply and demand stays the same, price is high. Economics from the standpoint of running a monopoly would probably be fun for most people, but I really loved using what I learned and getting results from it. </p></div>

	<div><p> 	After dabbling with some programming languages and courses (Udemy, <a href='https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-data-science-computational-uc-berkeleyx-data8-1x'>Berkeley Data 8</a>), I found that programming and learning from data is also pretty darn fun. I really enjoyed building/solving something and grinding for it. I think programming is similar to solving a jigsaw puzzle. Everyone wants the end product, but the process is meticulous and oftentimes requires teamwork. I think enjoying the process - a subset of the present - is really important.</p></div>

	<div><p>	I got into Cornell for Applied Economics and Management, or essentially business with a sexy sounding name. I want to learn more about programming and analysis but am not ready to completely drop my initial major, so I have decided to try and also pick up a Biometry and Statistics major and a Computer Science minor. I hope to be able to <a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/1401833413216649/'>handle the business AND technical sides</a>. ;) </p></div>

	<div> <p>	Well here I am, throwing this together at 3:34 AM during my summer break in hopes of learning more about web development. This website may imply that I am looking to become a software engineer, but to be honest, I am not quite sure what I want to do career-wise. However, I do know that I must keep exploring, adapting, and enjoying the process.</p></div>
